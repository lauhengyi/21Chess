21 quirky variations to the timeless classic

Ever think that there should be some new rules that should be added to chess? Or some new elements that could be added to chess that cause a complete overhaul in its gameplay? 21Chess is an app that introduces 21 variations to the timeless classic, excluding the normal chess(which it also includes). Examples of variations include:

Var.3 Scrambled Chess - Chess where the first 3 rows of the board are fully customizable by the player.

Var. 5 Broken Tiles Chess - Chess where the square where the previous piece moved off disappears temporarily.

Var. 12 Propaganda Chess - Chess where a piece surrounded by enemy pieces will change sides and turn into an enemy piece.

Var.17 Minesweeper Chess - It's like playing minesweeper but in chess.

...and much much more!
