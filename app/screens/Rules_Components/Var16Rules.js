      <RulesText settings={settings}>
        Cloner(One-time) - On it's next move, it will cause a copy of the piece

        Rooks, Bishops, Knights and Queens);
      </RulesText>
      <RulesText settings={settings}>

        able to gain other perks.
      </RulesText>
      <RulesText settings={settings}>
        For one-time perks, after the special move has been executed, the piece
